Instagram Clone App with Flutter
This is a mobile app built with Flutter that replicates some of the core features of the popular social media platform Instagram. The app allows users to create an account, log in, view their feed, post photos and videos, like and comment on posts, and follow other users.
Tech Stack Used
1.	Flutter - a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
2.	Firebase - a cloud-based platform for mobile and web app development that provides services such as authentication, database storage, and real-time data synchronization.
Features
1.	User authentication: Users can create an account and log in using their email and password.
2.	Feed view: Users can view a feed of posts from the users they follow, with infinite scrolling and pull-to-refresh functionality.
3.	Post creation: Users can create new posts by selecting an image or video from their device's gallery, adding a caption, and uploading it to the Firebase storage.
4.	Post interaction: Users can like and comment on posts, and see the likes and comments of other users.
5.	User profile: Users can view their own profile, edit their profile picture and bio, and view their own posts and followers.
6.	User search: Users can search for other users by their username and view their profiles.
7.	Follow functionality: Users can follow and unfollow other users, and view the list of users they are following and their followers.
Getting Started
To run the app, you will need to have Flutter and Firebase installed on your machine. Once you have cloned the repository, run the following commands in the terminal:
csharpCopy code
flutter pub get flutter run 
Make sure you have also set up a Firebase project and added the necessary configuration files to the project.
